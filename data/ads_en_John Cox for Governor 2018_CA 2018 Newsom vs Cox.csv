They have spent over $180,000 on right-wing candidates and initiatives, including $31,000 for the initiative to change local elections to June, and over $90,000 to support John Cox for Governor.\n\n𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐲 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐲?\n\nThey are spending heavily for attack mailers on the progressive candidates, and spent thousands on attack ads (radio, printed, and other media) prior to June 30th, ads intended to demonize the homeless and current councilmembers. They have gone negative from the start - posting ugly pics, name-calling, ugly memes, and misrepresenting facts. \n\nThey are paying for a “walk program” of the precincts - and spending heavily on Kami and Sean, only a bit less on Coolidge, and have spent thousands on mailers for all of them.\n\n𝐓𝐨 𝐭𝐨𝐩 𝐢𝐭 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐨𝐟𝐟, 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐲 𝐢𝐬 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐬 𝐟𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐚𝐬 𝐢𝐭 𝐜𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐢𝐧. \n\nThey have spent on consultants and services in Sacramento, San Diego, Hilmar, Laguna Niguel and beyond.\n\nThousands have been spent on Sacramento Valley Solutions, a shady consulting group in Yuba City favored by James Gallagher. \n\nThey have spent thousands on text messaging from RumbleUp, a Republican texting service in DC. \n\nTheir T-Shirts are printed in Pennsylvania. \n\nTheir printing and mailings are done in Sacramento. as well as other locations, just not Chico. \n\nIn fact, pretty much the only money they’ve spent locally has been for events, and even that is a pittance; for instance, WeDo Designs donated $8800 in services to them, and they paid them for an additional $1740 services. \n\n𝐒𝐨 𝐦𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬. \n\nAll this in a local election that is supposedly non-partisan, and in the face of CPD reporting that overall as well as most categories of crime are actually down, despite the city having grown by nearly 20,000 people. And that’s not per capita - literally, there have been fewer crimes overall in the city.\n\nFor the organizers, this is 100% about fooling the electorate via the trump playbook, not about “safety.” Don’t be fooled - and don’t allow them to take over our town.\n\n#StandUpChico   #WeAreChico \n\nJoin us: \n\n☑️ Sign up for our newsletter at www.standupchico.com\n\n☑️  Follow us on Instagram and Twitter @StandUpChico \n\n☑️  Help us fight back against misinformation and build up, rather than tear down our community:  https://secure.actblue.com/donate/standupchico""]",Stand Up for Chico,['en'],2020-09-04,2020-09-04,,
