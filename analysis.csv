Paul Bettencourt,en,R,"It is essential that the public trust the election process. Unfortunately, right here in Harris County, Democrats are undermining election security at every turn.\n\nA recent proclamation from Governor Greg Abbott to ensure that poll watchers have access to observe absentee ballots drop offs (as the law is on the books previously, with one location) has received swift condemnation under the usual Democrat mantra of suppression. (Read more: https://bit.ly/2Gtqh8G)\n\nHowever let\'s consider these simple truths:\n1) County Judge Hildago and County Clerk Hollins have been pushing past the Texas election code to try and mail 2,000,000+ Absentee ballot applications to voters and have been stopped by the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n2) This proclamation is the same law that was in place in the 2020 Primary, the 2018 Midterm, and the 2016 Presidential Election. Democrats in Harris County swept those elections in both 2016 and 2018 and there was no talk of suppression.\n\n3) Democrats regularly continue to deny voter fraud exists, just days after indictments came down against a Gregg County Commissioner and others for an organized vote harvesting scheme. \n\nAdd to this the recent contracts that are coming to light for contracts rammed through Commissioners Court by 3-2 partisan votes (for appointed County Clerk Hollins and totaling up to potentially one million dollars) for scopes of supply without a thorough purchasing contract being approved first. In other words, these contracts are not even complete, there are no performance metrics, but work is underway and you, the taxpayer, are being billed while every normal check and balance on purchasing has been ignored! These 12 companies were selected by the County Clerk based on what?! \n\nUpdate: In a great Texan\'s story, Holly Hansen goes into more detail on the contracts and other possible election corruption in the state.

State Rep. Julie Johnson,en,R,"I am so honored to have earned the endorsement of  The Dallas Morning News for two years in a row! Read the full text below:\n\nSince taking office, Johnson, 54, has proven an effective legislator who’s willing to work across the aisle. She has co-authored numerous bills with Republicans, most notably HB3, the sweeping and crucial $11.6 billion school-finance reform bill signed into law last year by Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nHer opponent, Republican Karyn Brownlee, a 54-year-old former public school principal in Coppell ISD, has somewhat toned down what had been a vocal embrace of a strong cultural conservative message — this in a time when North Texas voters have strongly signaled that isn’t the sort of government they want.\n\nBut Brownlee’s past focus on such concerns still separates her from Johnson’s more pragmatic approach to governing, which we think is a better fit for the district.\n\nWe were particularly concerned about Brownlee’s recent statement that Texans must be allowed to choose whether they will “mask up” in a time of pandemic. At this stage, the question of whether a state mask mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic is a “civil rights” issue is settled.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, has built a record of bipartisan legislative success. And she is getting broad support in response. She has gained the endorsement of the Dallas Police Association, for example, and says the phrase “defunding the police” has become a “dog whistle” that doesn’t accurately represent the police reforms she favors, including better funding community mental health care and ending “no-knock warrants.\n\nWhen it comes to charter schools, neither candidate supports them in the way we would have liked. Brownlee said that while she’s not opposed to them, “Frankly, the data is still out on whether or not charter schools actually improve public schools.” While Johnson said flat out, “I’m not a fan of charter schools. I think that that funding should be put directly into the public-school system.”\n\nWhile we have our differences with some of Johnson’s more liberal legislative initiatives, we give the nod to Johnson for her proven ability to reach across the aisle, legislate effectively, and tend to the needs of her constituents in a level-headed manner without being dragged down by the hot-button issues of the day.\n\nhttps://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/2020/09/22/our-recommendation-for-texas-house-district-115/","to es, the endorsement of The Dallas Morning News for two years in",4.1002,3.7592,0.3410000000000002,-0.3410000000000002

"Mayor Scott Bradley, City of Murphy",en,R,"There seems to be a lot of confusion concerning the Governors face mask Executive Order, his companion Proclamation and Collin County Judge Hills Proclamation.  How should we interpret them and what does it mean for Murphy?\n\n1) Under the Governors Executive Order, as of 12:01 PM on July 3rd the Governor required face coverings in most Texas Counties.  With some exceptions including: \n- any person younger than 10 years of age;\n- any person with a medical condition or disability that prevents wearing a face covering;\n- any person while the person is consuming food or drink, or is seated at a restaurant to eat or drink;\n\n2) Under the Governors Executive order the he further orders local law enforcement to enforce the order as follows: \n- verbal or written warning for a first-time violator, \n- Second and subsequent violations shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $250. \n\nFull Stop - that is where the conversations about facecoverings end and I encourage you to read the executive order by the Governor.  \n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nIn addition to the executive order, the Governor also issued a proclamation amending his June 26th Executive Order granting some power to County Judges and Mayors in relation to gatherings larger than 10 people:\n\nIt reads:   For any outdoor gathering in excess of 10 people, other than those set forth above in paragraph numbers 1, 2, or 4, the gathering is prohibited unless the mayor of the city in which the gathering is held, or the county judge in the case of a gathering in an unincorporated area, approves of the gathering, and such approval can be made subject to certain conditions or restrictions not inconsistent with this executive order.\n\nI have already done this and the drive in movie night at Kimbrough Stadium and the Graduation Parade are prime examples.\n\nIMPORTANT\nThis is not a change to the current language about gatherings greater than 10 people.  It creates no additional restrictions it simply clarifies that County Judges and Mayors have the authority on a case by case basis to authorize larger gatherings in controlled ways.  As we are already doing... \n\nFollowing the Governors Proclamation, Collin County Judge Hill issue his own Proclamation declaring that Collin County citizens are permitted to have outdoor gatherings in excess of 10 people.\n\nUnfortunately, the Governors Proclamation does not give him the authority to make that broad of an order.  The Governors order only authorized him to authority over unincorporated areas.   \n\nThank you and I appreciate your support as we navigate this together.",es: There seems to be a lot of confusion concerning the Governors face,2.6761,2.8235,-0.1474000000000002,0.1474000000000002

Dan Flynn for Texas,en,R,"I appreciate the Governor listening to the needs of Texans and addressing this very important issue. As many of you know, I’ve written him about this multiple times called for a freeze on appraisals to lower property taxes. The Legislature has continually worked to cap rate increases and it would be a poor decision for any local government to even consider rate increases at a time like this. However, local governments have found a way to raise property taxes that circumvents the rate increases the Legislature worked so hard to address. They now increase their tax base using appraisal increases. Texans need relief from property taxes now! Next session reforming the appraisal process will be my top priority, and I look forward to working with the Governor to get it done.","Ich schätze den Gouverneur, der die Bedürfnisse der Texaner",4.1129,4.1515,-0.038600000000000634,0.038600000000000634

Save the Alamo,en,R,"PLEASE SEE THIS REMARKABLE ARTICLE\n\nHopefully, due to our overwhelming success in this last Election, George P. Bush may not be in charge over the Alamo where he is in a position to menace it for too much longer.\n\n****************************\n\nLt. Gov. Attacks George P. Bush Over Alamo Project After Rumors Surface That Bush Plans to Challenge Patrick\n\nBY TYLER O\'NEIL MARCH 6, 2020\n\nRemember the Alamo! might become a divisive political slogan as Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has accused his fellow Republican, Land Commissioner George P. Bush, of leading the Alamo restoration project badly off track. His remarks came one day before the 184th anniversary of the fall of the Alamo, a military defeat that energized the Texas revolution against Mexico and helped America\'s second-most populous state enter the Union.\n\nNothing defines the independent and the courageous spirit of Texas more than our iconic Alamo and, like most Texans, I treasure it. The history of the Alamo is a personal passion of mine. I do not intend to sit quietly and see this project fail, Patrick said in a statement slamming Bush, son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and grandson of President George H. W. Bush. The job of oversight for this project is the responsibility of the General Land Office headed by Commissioner George P. Bush. It is evident to me that both the design, planning, and execution of the project is badly off track.\n\nBush has long received criticism over the General Land Office and the City of San Antonio\'s plan to reimagine the site of the Alamo. Texans are incensed over the plan to relocate the Alamo Cenotaph, a monument commissioned on the centennial anniversary of the Battle of the Alamo that serves as a tombstone for the men who gave their lives in the fight for Texas independence in the historic siege (February 23-March 6, 1836).\n\nOn Tuesday, Republican voters overwhelmingly approved a proposition on the GOP primary ballot stating, Texans should protect and preserve all historical monuments, artifacts, and buildings, such as the Alamo Cenotaph and our beloved Alamo, and should oppose any reimagining of the Alamo site. Nearly 98 percent of Republican voters supported it.\nPatrick slammed Bush over the Cenotaph relocation and the look and design of new buildings on the site.\n\nThe latest design looks like a massive urban park with hundreds of trees—more like Central Park in New York City than Alamo Plaza, the lieutenant governor said. We have wasted significant public dollars on designs which most Texans would immediately reject. He called on Bush to release all proposed architectural designs and threatened to move the project to another entity in the absence of significant change.\n\nIf the General Land Office cannot handle this important job, and to date it does not appear it can, I will recommend we identify another entity to provide oversight, Patrick warned.\nLate Thursday, Bush spokeswoman Karina Erickson said the land commissioner welcomes Patrick\'s suggestions, the Dallas Morning News reported.\n\nLt. Governor Patrick brings up many great ideas -- ideas that are already incorporated in the Alamo Plan, including the intent to restore the Alamo Church and Battleground to the 1836 time period, Erickson said.\n\nPatrick demanded that the restoration effort should include a world-class visitor center focused on the 1836 Battle of the Alamo, not the 200-year history of early Spanish settlement in Texas, which is covered by San Antonio\'s Mission Trail. Erickson insisted that a focus on the battle will be the focal point of the restoration.\n\nThe Texas legislature approved funds for preserving the Alamo and rebuilding the plaza in 2015. Lawmakers intended for Texans and others to be able to see the battlefield as it was in 1836, Patrick insisted.\n\nA recent records request exposed another controversy. Members of the Alamo Defenders Descendants Association condemned digging in a graveyard.\n\nYet the political battle may trace back to Bush\'s decision to spread rumors that he may challenge Patrick in the 2022 lieutenant governor race. Lieutenant governor is the most powerful position in the Texas government when the legislature is in session because it controls the state Senate\'s agenda. While the legislature is not scheduled to meet again until January 2021, Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Texas) may call the legislature into a special session to deal with this issue, which would humiliate Bush.\n\nIn October, Bush\'s senior advisor, J. R. Hernandez, insisted that the land commissioner remains focused on his job, attempting to dispel rumors of a planned run against Patrick. Over the last few months, several activists and donors have asked Commissioner Bush to consider higher office in Texas, Hernandez admitted.

Fallon For Texas,en,R,"COVID-19 TEXAS UPDATE\nLT Gov Patrick \nCONFERENCE CALL\nSUNDAY April 5th \n\nI just recently had a conference call with Governor Abbott and had a separate call with Lt Gov Patrick regarding the Covid-19 virus and the challenges that it has presented to us as a state and as a nation.  My staff and I have been fielding hundreds of calls, emails and messages from our wonderful bosses (our constituents) and also are doing a tremendous amount of research on the virus, its effects and best practices from around the country and the world.  \n\nHERE IS OUR LATEST UPDATE\n(I pray you will find it informative and helpful):\n\nIS TEXAS NOW UNDER A ‘SHELTER IN PLACE’ or ‘STAY AT HOME ORDER’?\n\nThe Gov announced uniform guidelines for all Texans over the past week.  Essentially he directed Texans not to leave their homes for any reason other than to perform essential functions (grocery store, doctor’s visit, bank etc... or of course go to/from an essential job) or to exercise alone or with family/persons with which you are living...and practice 6 feet social distancing with anyone else.  \n\nNEW EXECUTIVE ORDERS:\n\n3/31 - EO GA-14: Governor Greg Abbott issued an Executive Order implementing Essential Services and Activities Protocols for the entire state of Texas. The protocols direct all Texans to minimize non-essential gatherings and in-person contact with people who are not in the same household. The Governor’s Executive Order renews and amends his previous order enforcing federal social distancing guidelines for COVID-19, including closing schools and instructing Texans to avoid eating or drinking at bars and restaurants. The protocols allow exceptions for essential activities and services based on the Department of Homeland Security’s guidelines on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce. Examples of these essential services include healthcare, grocery stores, banking and financial services, utilities, child care for essential service employees, and government services. \n\n3/30: Governor Abbott Issues Executive Order Mandating 14-Day Quarantine For Travelers Arriving From CA, LA, WA, Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, and Miami.\n\n3/30: Governor Abbott Prohibits Release Of Individuals In Custody With History Of Offenses Involving Physical Violence\n\nIt’s worth staring this again...the truth, unvarnished and frank.  If we all did what the President and Governor are asking us to do-we’d be on the other side of this in less than a month.  Period.  But some folks aren’t and by doing so they’re putting lives at risk and contributing to a potential economic Armageddon.   This must stop right now!  Nobody wants to be in this situation but here we are.  We MUST UNITE, act responsibly & with care and make this a memory as soon as we possibly can!\n\nSo, if I had to label our situation in Texas I’d call it ESSENTIAL LIVING.  And let’s hope it ends as soon as possible!!!\n\nAs of today, any person violating the Governor’s executive orders is subject to a $1,000 fine and 180 confinement.  \n\nFor a list of ALL of Governor Abbott’s Executive Orders, please feel free to visit this link: https://gov.texas.gov/\n\nHOW LONG WILL THIS GO ON?\n\nThat’s the very question we all ask ourselves and our friends/neighbors seemingly on a daily basis.  On our conference call tonight, LT Gov Patrick, who is in direct communication with the President, shared that the next 2 weeks here in Texas and across the country will be the toughest we’ve faced and will be very telling.  We may reach the crest of the curve (God willing) and then, by later this month, see a precipitous decline in new cases, hospitalizations and deaths.  Let’s all pray that’s the case.  If it is, I suspect we may see some small steps being taken to begin to transition toward some semblance of normalcy.  Please know that this will be a process and we will gradually return to normal.  It won’t happen all at once or right away.  \n\nCORONAVIRUS CASES IN TEXAS \n\nBy the numbers:  \n\n  DATE          CONFIRMED CASES \nMar 4                             1\nMar 11                           21\nMar 13                          39\nMar 19                         158\nMar 21                          201\nMar 22                         334\nApril 5                        6,812\n\n71,000 have been tested.  We are waiting on results for a significant portion.  About 10% of those tested are coming back positive.  \n\nPlease don’t be alarmed by the explosive growth in confirmed cases.  This is what to be expected all along.  And as more testing becomes available and tests are given these numbers will grow exponentially.  Some experts estimate whatever the confirmed cases are, at this stage, multiply that x50.  There indeed may be 20,000 cases in Texas.  Maybe more, maybe a lot more, but also maybe less.  The reason why such drastic actions have been taken is to reduce the explosive growth that occurs with this virus if left unchecked.  \n\nBottom line is, If you’ve been exposed PLEASE self isolate.  And of course, if you are positive for the virus you MUST isolate!!!  \n\nDEATHS in TEXAS:\n\nTwo weeks ago on March 22nd we’d suffered 6 deaths.  By April 5th it’s now at 133.\n\nTEXAS COMPARED TO OTHER STATES:\n\nWe have all seen on the news that New York is the American epicenter for Covid-19 and has been hit the hardest of any state.  The statistics bear this out.  As of 5 April 2020 the US has had 336,830 confirmed covid-19 cases and tragically 9,618 deaths.  In New York alone there have been 123,018 confirmed cases (37% of all US cases) and 4,159 deaths (43%).  These numbers are even more shocking when you consider that NY’s population of 19.4 million accounts for just 6% of all Americans.  \n\nIn Texas, by comparison, our numbers are thankfully much lower.  \nWith a population of 29 million, we are a full one third larger than NY but have just 6,812 confirmed cases and 133 deaths.   In fact, on a per capita basis Texas ranks 44th in confirmed cases per million (253).  The hardest hit, New York is at 6,271 per million and the lowest per capita of 169 belongs to Minnesota.  Deaths per million is also highest in New York at 212.  Texas is again one of the lesser impacted states at 5 per million and West Virginia is the lowest at 2 per million.  I share these figures not to minimize the impact that this awful virus has had on our state but to provide some context and comparison as to how this awful virus has disproportionately hit certain areas.  \n\nThe city that has suffered the most deaths per capita may be a surprise to some people.  It’s not New York but rather New Orleans.  Two reasons are most likely behind this.  One, The Big Easy traditionally ranks at the top of the most unhealthy cities in the nation.  Obesity and diabetes rates are very high there and when you coupled it with the very bad decision to go ahead with Mardi Gras festivities several weeks back this is the result.  \n\nCORONAVIRUS CASES IN SENATE DISTRICT 30 \n\nBy the numbers:\n\nAPRIL 5th SD 30 Counties Cases:\n\nArcher - 0\nClay - 1\nCollin - 256\nCooke - 0\nDenton - 288\nErath - 9\nGrayson - 12\nJack - 0\nMontague - 1\nPalo Pinto - 1\nParker - 6\nWichita - 46\nWise - 3\nYoung - 3\n\nBy comparison this is where we were two weeks ago in March 5th SD 30 Counties:\n\nArcher - 0\nClay - 0\nCollin - 21\nCooke - 0\nDenton - 12\nErath - 0\nGrayson - 0\nJack - 0\nMontague - 0\nPalo Pinto - 0\nParker - 0\nWichita - 3\nWise - 0\nYoung - 0\n\nTHE TESTING SITUATION \n\nMar 13    220 tested-virus in 10 counties\n \nMar 19    2,335 tested-virus in 31 counties \n\nMar 20     5,300 tested-virus in 34 counties \n\nMar 22    8,756 tested- virus in 43 counties \n\nApril 5    71,000 tested-virus in 151 counties \n\nPREVENTATIVE MEASURES\n \nWe are on on the front lines and we must be aggressive and disciplined on the containment of this virus.  This is not the flu.  It spreads quicker, last longer on surfaces and is more deadly per capita.  \n\nWe are front line soldiers.  We are all front line soldiers during this struggle.  This will end quicker if you do your job!  This is truly and literally a matter of life and death.  Not to mention the enormous economic implications.  \n\nPlease practice these simple precautions:  \n\n—wash your hands for 20 sec with soap and warm water frequently during the day and especially after touching commonly used surfaces or going outside your home and ALWAYS after going to the market or any other store!\n\n—disinfect surfaces touched often\n\n—Avoid touching your face during the day \n\n—avoid those that are sick\n\n—If you are ill (flu, covid) STAY at home and self isolate...unless you’re in bad shape...and in that case seek immediate medical care \n\n—eliminate close contacts.  Stay 6 feet from all people other than ones you’re living with at home and self isolating with \n\n—no social gatherings.  Do NOT attend any social gatherings.  This is the best way to spread the virus.  Please remember most people who have the virus won’t even know it and will unknowingly spread it-sometimes for 2 weeks!  There was an instance is South Korea where one positive case had 1,160 contacts with other people!  Not everyone this person made contact with got the virus or spread it but scores did! \n\nTo get the most recent updates on coronavirus in Texas feel free to visit:\n\nhttps://www.dshs.texas.gov\n\nPPE AND TEXT KIT SHORTAGES \n\nOur medical professionals are on the front lines.  There is indeed a worldwide shortage of PPE and testing kits.  The State is Texas and the Governor’s office is doing everything possible to get more PPE.  \n\nThe Governor’s STRIKE FORCE is doing everything in their power to locate and purchase much needed supplies that will protect our heroic medical personnel, law enforcement and many other essential workers that are keeping us safe, fed, healthy and protected during this crisis.   They are procuring desperately needed PPE (personal protection equipment) AND testing kits from around the world.  The federal government is promising to ramp up production of all critically needed medical supplies and we thank them for that.  But Texas isn’t going to wait around and have the feds be our only source.  The Gov has tapped Keith Meyers (former head of worldwide procurement for Dell...who’s taking in unpaid leave to perform this very important task full time) to head this effort and he will be assisted by my former colleague, Dr John Zerwas, retired State Rep.  They are scouring the world in search of purchasing supplies we desperately need.  We have the funds to do so, we just need the product.  \n\nThe Gov also tapped Elana Mendoza to tackle the logistics of enduring all of our medical professionals daycare needs are met while they are saving lives at the forefront of this challenge.  \n\nOVERALL MEDICAL CAPACITY \n\nHospitals are currently (and fortunately) NOT at full capacity.  We have 84,000 hospital beds in our state and have 16,000 (and that figure may now be as high as 20,000) beds reserved and designated for Covid-19 patients.  The Gov’s executive order from a few weeks back to suspend elective procedures and also waiving regulations to allow two non-contagious patients hospitalized for reasons other than Covid-19 to share the same hospital room has greatly expanded our capacity to confront this situation.  The GOOD news to share is, at this point, we have only used about 6% of our capacity for Covid-19 patients as we currently have 1,100 hospitalized.  \n\nSOME GOOD NEWS:\n\nMy colleague, Senator Bryan Hughes, and his law firm have some clients who had a stockpile of hydroxychloroquine, which has shown tremendous promise in helping treat and mitigate the impact and effects of this virus.  His clients DONATED one million doses to the state of Texas!  Additionally they asked that Sen Hughes and his firm reach out to other states that may be in need.  They offered to donate 4 million additional doses!!!\n\nNow we’re all in this together so my aim is not to play a game of gotcha but simply to share that MOST states have been very receptive.  They’ve ripped through the red tape and gladly accepted this Texans generosity.  But unfortunately, not all of them!  New York, who has the greatest need, did take longer than expected, but I’m happy to report that they have accepted 2 million free doses.  Illinois, Michigan and New Jersey still haven’t come around and are playing bureaucratic games.  Lives are at stake so let’s all hope and pray that the leadership of these hard hit states grab a pair of scissors and starting cutting through the damn red tape!   \n\nFROM OUR HEART:\n\nWe posted on Facebook earlier this week that if there is ANYONE in Senate District 30 (Grayson, Parker, Wise, Wichita, Collin, Denton, Cooke, Erath, Jack, Young, Archer, Clay, Montague or Palo Pinto Counties) who has run out of money and is in need of food, to please private message me on Facebook (Patrick Fallon) and we will get you some groceries.  These are unprecedented times and we’re in uncharted waters.  Never before have Americans been ordered NOT to work, not to make a living and not to earn money for their families.  But the bills and expenses don’t stop.  If you need food we will be there for you.  We are Americans.  We are brothers and sisters.  We are family and we are in this together!  If you’d like to volunteer or contribute to this cause please also feel free to private message me as well.  \n\nThis is what we know at present.  These next two weeks are going to be tough.  Governor Abbott, Lt Gov Patrick and myself included, are asking you to take extra care and caution.  If you don’t have to leave your home, don’t.  We know that you love your country, your community and your family.  Let’s all follow the guidelines put in place and we’ll get through this thing quicker and out the other side and go back to living the lives with which we have been blessed with an additional vigor and thankfulness moving forward!  \n\nAs soon as our office knows more we will let you know.  My staff has put in countless hours and are doing a spectacular job.  Senate District 30’s Virtual Office is open during this crisis and we are all committed to making ourselves available day and night to answer any questions, hear any ideas, thoughts or concerns you’d like to share.\n\nGod bless you and God bless Texas and our nation.  We will get through this and we will be stronger on the other side!\n\n#TexasStrong \n\n       PAT\nPat Fallon, Member\nTexas Senate\nNorth & Central Texas\n\n(please forgive any typos or grammatical errors as this update was typed on on IPhone by a very tired man with fat thumbs!)",: COVID-19 TEXAS UPDATEnLT Gov Patrick,2.6839,2.7841,-0.10020000000000007,0.10020000000000007

While it is our choice to focus on what is going well while we seek solutions, no one who lives here is denying there are reasons for concern. \n\nChico absorbed 20,000 people into our community in literally days in 2018, a resettlement process that remains ongoing. \n\nLike so much of the rest of the state, we have a crisis with homelessness. And like so much of the rest of the country, we remain in the midst of an opioid epidemic. \n\nAnd then came the pandemic. Businesses are struggling, many are unemployed, and as cases continue to rise, it's hard to see the end. It's been a rough couple of years for what has often been a tightly-knit community and too many of us are struggling.  \n\nWe also want to acknowledge that of course, there is crime in our community, and as long as there is crime, even at reduced numbers, we can do better. \n\nThere is a lot of work to be done and it will take all of us in the coming years to turn some of these things around. It won't be fast, no matter who is on the city council - it can't be. These are huge problems and they are going to take time and resources to solve.\n\nThat said, we are extremely concerned about the attempt to buy our upcoming election.\n\n𝐍𝐨𝐰, 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐭𝐨 𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐬\n\nFor its founders and major funders, “Safe Chico” was never about safety. They have claimed for months to be non-partisan, and that they are supported by Democrats, Independents, etc. but make no mistake, far-right Republicans, many from out of the area, are trying to buy our local election.\n\n$215,000 in cash has come in, an outrageous amount for a small local election, and that doesn’t include in-kind donations, i.e. non-cash donations such as catering for their fundraisers. For a local PAC to raise this kind of money is unprecedented – they are spending record amounts on this election. (You can read these filings yourself here: https://public.netfile.com/pub2/?AID=chco Search by name and simply type in “Safe.”)\n\nFollowing that money tells the real story.\n\nOver $30,000 has come in from people that don’t even live in Chico - some from as far away as Florida and New Jersey. That amount alone is only a little less than the highest-spending PAC poured into the last election. \n\nJames Gallagher, 3rd District Republican Assemblyman, dumped in another $10,000.\n\n$77,000 has come in from developers/real estate/property management and contractors.\n\nThe Dautermans (Thomas Manufacturing, Tea Party) have poured in $7700 recently and have more to spend. They have spent over $180,000 on right-wing candidates and initiatives, including $31,000 for the initiative to change local elections to June, and over $90,000 to support John Cox for Governor.\n\n𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐲 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐲?\n\nThey are spending heavily for attack mailers on the progressive candidates, and spent thousands on attack ads (radio, printed, and other media) prior to June 30th, ads intended to demonize the homeless and current councilmembers. They have gone negative from the start - posting ugly pics, name-calling, ugly memes, and misrepresenting facts. \n\nThey are paying for a “walk program” of the precincts - and spending heavily on Kami and Sean, only a bit less on Coolidge, and have spent thousands on mailers for all of them.\n\n𝐓𝐨 𝐭𝐨𝐩 𝐢𝐭 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐨𝐟𝐟, 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐲 𝐢𝐬 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐬 𝐟𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐚𝐬 𝐢𝐭 𝐜𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐢𝐧. \n\nThey have spent on consultants and services in Sacramento, San Diego, Hilmar, Laguna Niguel and beyond.\n\nThousands have been spent on Sacramento Valley Solutions, a shady consulting group in Yuba City favored by James Gallagher. \n\nThey have spent thousands on text messaging from RumbleUp, a Republican texting service in DC. \n\nTheir T-Shirts are printed in Pennsylvania. \n\nTheir printing and mailings are done in Sacramento. as well as other locations, just not Chico. \n\nIn fact, pretty much the only money they’ve spent locally has been for events, and even that is a pittance; for instance, WeDo Designs donated $8800 in services to them, and they paid them for an additional $1740 services. \n\n𝐒𝐨 𝐦𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬. \n\nAll this in a local election that is supposedly non-partisan, and in the face of CPD reporting that overall as well as most categories of crime are actually down, despite the city having grown by nearly 20,000 people.

It's been a rough couple of years for what has often been a tightly-knit community and too many of us are struggling.  \n\nWe also want to acknowledge that of course, there is crime in our community, and as long as there is crime, even at reduced numbers, we can do better. \n\nThere is a lot of work to be done and it will take all of us in the coming years to turn some of these things around. It won't be fast, no matter who is on the city council - it can't be. These are huge problems and they are going to take time and resources to solve.\n\nThat said, we are extremely concerned about the attempt to buy our upcoming election.\n\n𝐍𝐨𝐰, 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐭𝐨 𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐬\n\nFor its founders and major funders, “Safe Chico” was never about safety. They have claimed for months to be non-partisan, and that they are supported by Democrats, Independents, etc. but make no mistake, far-right Republicans, many from out of the area, are trying to buy our local election.\n\n$215,000 in cash has come in, an outrageous amount for a small local election, and that doesn’t include in-kind donations, i.e. non-cash donations such as catering for their fundraisers. For a local PAC to raise this kind of money is unprecedented – they are spending record amounts on this election. (You can read these filings yourself here: https://public.netfile.com/pub2/?AID=chco Search by name and simply type in “Safe.”)\n\nFollowing that money tells the real story.\n\nOver $30,000 has come in from people that don’t even live in Chico - some from as far away as Florida and New Jersey. That amount alone is only a little less than the highest-spending PAC poured into the last election. \n\nJames Gallagher, 3rd District Republican Assemblyman, dumped in another $10,000.\n\n$77,000 has come in from developers/real estate/property management and contractors.\n\nThe Dautermans (Thomas Manufacturing, Tea Party) have poured in $7700 recently and have more to spend. They have spent over $180,000 on right-wing candidates and initiatives, including $31,000 for the initiative to change local elections to June, and over $90,000 to support John Cox for Governor.\n\n𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐲 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐲?\n\nThey are spending heavily for attack mailers on the progressive candidates, and spent thousands on attack ads (radio, printed, and other media) prior to June 30th, ads intended to demonize the homeless and current councilmembers. They have gone negative from the start - posting ugly pics, name-calling, ugly memes, and misrepresenting facts. \n\nThey are paying for a “walk program” of the precincts - and spending heavily on Kami and Sean, only a bit less on Coolidge, and have spent thousands on mailers for all of them.\n\n𝐓𝐨 𝐭𝐨𝐩 𝐢𝐭 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐨𝐟𝐟, 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐲 𝐢𝐬 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐬 𝐟𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐚𝐬 𝐢𝐭 𝐜𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐢𝐧. \n\nThey have spent on consultants and services in Sacramento, San Diego, Hilmar, Laguna Niguel and beyond.\n\nThousands have been spent on Sacramento Valley Solutions, a shady consulting group in Yuba City favored by James Gallagher. \n\nThey have spent thousands on text messaging from RumbleUp, a Republican texting service in DC. \n\nTheir T-Shirts are printed in Pennsylvania. \n\nTheir printing and mailings are done in Sacramento. as well as other locations, just not Chico. \n\nIn fact, pretty much the only money they’ve spent locally has been for events, and even that is a pittance; for instance, WeDo Designs donated $8800 in services to them, and they paid them for an additional $1740 services. \n\n𝐒𝐨 𝐦𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬. \n\nAll this in a local election that is supposedly non-partisan, and in the face of CPD reporting that overall as well as most categories of crime are actually down, despite the city having grown by nearly 20,000 people. And that’s not per capita - literally, there have been fewer crimes overall in the city.\n\nFor the organizers, this is 100% about fooling the electorate via the trump playbook, not about “safety.” Don’t be fooled - and don’t allow them to take over our town.\n\n#StandUpChico   #WeAreChico \n\nJoin us: \n\n☑️ Sign up for our newsletter at www.standupchico.com\n\n☑️  Follow us on Instagram and Twitter @StandUpChico \n\n☑️  Help us fight back against misinformation and build up, rather than tear down our community:  https://secure.actblue.com/donate/standupchico","to es: Let’s Talk About PACs, Part 2:",2.2416,3.4227,-1.1810999999999998,1.1810999999999998

Trump considers for the US Supreme Court.\nJudge Bárbara  Lagoa  has an excellent background in Miami with a honorable law practice profile. She was born in this Florida city to parents who fled  the  communist government of Fidel Castro and grew up bilingual and conservative. \nNow we hope she will be the first Cuban/American born judge on the  Court  Supreme  of  United States.\nPresident Donald J. Trump  confirmed Monday that  Lagoa , 52, is one of the five judges shortlisted  to  replace  the Honorable Ruth Bader Ginsburg, progressive and feminist judge of the  US  Supreme Court who died Friday  at  age 87.\nJudge Lagoa  is part of the  Court  of Appeals of Atlanta, she was judge of the  Supreme  Court of Florida. As an attorney she defended in pro bono in Miami  to  the family  of the  rafter  Elián  González , 20 years ago.\nIf appointed, she would become a credit and the second Hispanic judge after Sonia Sotomayor, of Puerto Rican origin, of the nine judges that make up the largest US Supreme Court. She would also be the only conservative of the three female magistrates.\n“She is excellent. She is Hispanic. She is a wonderful woman, as far as I know. I don\'t know her. Florida; we love Florida, ” Trump told   Fox Channel Monday.\nBorn in 1967, Judge Lagoa  grew up in Hialeah, a low-income Cuban town in West Miami. His parents had fled  from the  Castroism in the second migratory wave that eventually gave a distinctive Cuban flavor  to  this city  of the  south of Florida.\nShe is the mother of three daughters, she attended a Catholic school in Hialeah and then Florida International University, before graduating as a lawyer from the prestigious Columbia University in New York in 1992.\nJudge Lagoa  was part  of the  legal pro bono team that represented  to  the Miami relatives of  Elián  González, the little 5 year old was claimed by his father in Cuba after the died mother in the wreckage of the raft with which escaped with his son  to  late 1999.\nJudge Lagoa  continued to climb the ranks until, in January 2019, she became the first Hispanic and the first Cuban/American to be a judge on    the Florida Supreme Court, nominated by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis.\nLess than a year later,  President Trump  elected her as judge on the Atlanta Federal Court of Appeals. His appointment was confirmed by a bipartisan majority in the Senate, with 80 votes  in  favor and only 15 against.\nAs a judge on the appeals court, she made a ruling that can suppress the suffrage of tens of thousands of former Florida convicts, who will now be required  to  pay their court fines before they can register  to  vote.\n We strongly support the Honorable Bárbara Lagoa\nYours truly,  Humphrey H.

As we reflect on the horror of that night, we must recognize that much still needs to be done to protect our LGBTQ+ community. \n\nInjustices are often intersectional. And transgender people, particularly Black transgender women, face a much higher level of violence in our country. According to the Human Rights Campaign, at least 26 transgender Americans were killed in 2019. This year, at least 12 deaths of transgender Americans have been reported — and there are likely many more that go unrecognized. It is necessary  to come together to protect our LGBTQ+ communities; that work needs be done from the local all the way up to the federal levels. \n\nLexington has made great strides with LGBTQ+ equality, but we should work to increase services and protections that benefit everyone within our city.

The Salon at Panama City Mall,en,R,"Dear Clients,\n\nAs some of you may have seen, Governor DeSantis has lifted the no-work order on hair salons, hairstylists and cosmetologists beginning May 11th. \n\nWith that being said, there are still questions that remain unanswered before we, as an industry, can resume a normal course of business. \n\nJC Penney's is taking a phased and prudent approach to reopening stores, and we’re putting the safety of our customers and associates first. While some local and state orders have allowed salons to reopen, our salons remain temporarily closed. We will reopen the salons as soon as it’s safe to do so and look forward to welcoming our customers back.\n\nThe Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulations has just provided our industry with guidelines, policies, procedures, and safeguards to put into place to ensure both the cosmetologist and the environment are protected as much as possible when working in close physical contact with clients. \n\nOnce those expectations from the State are provided to hairstylists, JC Penney's will then have to order supplies and equipment to meet the States' standards and protect you and our health as much as possible. Unfortunately, a large amount of the supplies we need in cosmetology are also supplies in high demand throughout the world and are very scarce at this moment. Think of the toilet paper shortage on a global scale. Latex gloves, masks, disinfectants, paper towels, sanitizers, wipes, aprons, etc. These supplies are going to be extremely difficult to obtain. \n\nIt’s important to understand that I believe your cosmetology needs go far beyond just aesthetics and personal appearance, but have a significant impact on our mental, emotional and spiritual health. That being said, it’s important to appreciate the risks your hairstylist is placing on you, their health, and the health of their family when having such close physical contact with members of the public. \n\nI hope you understand and I can’t wait to see you all again, but I want to see you happy and HEALTHY for years to come, not just right now. Your stylist will be contacting you to schedule your appointment ASAP. \n\nSo that you understand what is expected of us, and what is expected of you as the client, below are the orders put out by FDBPR for all salons as they reopen.

Dump Trumpism,en,R,"What does the world see when they look at the USA now? Here’s what Ireland’s most respected mainstream political writer says. Brace yourself. \n\nIrish Times\nApril 25, 2020\nBy Fintan O’Toole\n\nTHE WORLD HAS LOVED, HATED AND ENVIED THE U.S. NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE PITY IT\n\nOver more than two centuries, the United States has stirred a very wide range of feelings in the rest of the world: love and hatred, fear and hope, envy and contempt, awe and anger. But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the US until now: pity.\n\nHowever bad things are for most other rich democracies, it is hard not to feel sorry for Americans. Most of them did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016. Yet they are locked down with a malignant narcissist who, instead of protecting his people from Covid-19, has amplified its lethality. The country Trump promised to make great again has never in its history seemed so pitiful.\n\nWill American prestige ever recover from this shameful episode? The US went into the coronavirus crisis with immense advantages: precious weeks of warning about what was coming, the world’s best concentration of medical and scientific expertise, effectively limitless financial resources, a military complex with stunning logistical capacity and most of the world’s leading technology corporations. Yet it managed to make itself the global epicentre of the pandemic.\n\nAs the American writer George Packer puts it in the current edition of the Atlantic, “The United States reacted ... like Pakistan or Belarus – like a country with shoddy infrastructure and a dysfunctional government whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.”\n\nIt is one thing to be powerless in the face of a natural disaster, quite another to watch vast power being squandered in real time – wilfully, malevolently, vindictively. It is one thing for governments to fail (as, in one degree or another, most governments did), quite another to watch a ruler and his supporters actively spread a deadly virus. Trump, his party and Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News became vectors of the pestilence.\n\nThe grotesque spectacle of the president openly inciting people (some of them armed) to take to the streets to oppose the restrictions that save lives is the manifestation of a political death wish. What are supposed to be daily briefings on the crisis, demonstrative of national unity in the face of a shared challenge, have been used by Trump merely to sow confusion and division. They provide a recurring horror show in which all the neuroses that haunt the American subconscious dance naked on live TV.\n\nIf the plague is a test, its ruling political nexus ensured that the US would fail it at a terrible cost in human lives. In the process, the idea of the US as the world’s leading nation – an idea that has shaped the past century – has all but evaporated.\n\nOther than the Trump impersonator Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, who is now looking to the US as the exemplar of anything other than what not to do? How many people in Düsseldorf or Dublin are wishing they lived in Detroit or Dallas?\n\nIt is hard to remember now but, even in 2017, when Trump took office, the conventional wisdom in the US was that the Republican Party and the broader framework of US political institutions would prevent him from doing too much damage. This was always a delusion, but the pandemic has exposed it in the most savage ways.\n\nAbject surrender\n\nWhat used to be called mainstream conservatism has not absorbed Trump – he has absorbed it. Almost the entire right-wing half of American politics has surrendered abjectly to him. It has sacrificed on the altar of wanton stupidity the most basic ideas of responsibility, care and even safety.\n\nThus, even at the very end of March, 15 Republican governors had failed to order people to stay at home or to close non-essential businesses. In Alabama, for example, it was not until April 3rd that governor Kay Ivey finally issued a stay-at-home order.\n\nIn Florida, the state with the highest concentration of elderly people with underlying conditions, governor Ron DeSantis, a Trump mini-me, kept the beach resorts open to students travelling from all over the US for spring break parties. Even on April 1st, when he issued restrictions, DeSantis exempted religious services and “recreational activities”.\n\nGeorgia governor Brian Kemp, when he finally issued a stay-at-home order on April 1st, explained: “We didn’t know that the virus can be spread by people without symptoms until the last 24 hours.”\n\nThis is not mere ignorance – it is deliberate and homicidal stupidity. There is, as the demonstrations this week in US cities have shown, plenty of political mileage in denying the reality of the pandemic. It is fuelled by Fox News and far-right internet sites, and it reaps for these politicians millions of dollars in donations, mostly (in an ugly irony) from older people who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus.\n\nIt draws on a concoction of conspiracy theories, hatred of science, paranoia about the “deep state” and religious providentialism (God will protect the good folks) that is now very deeply infused in the mindset of the American right.\n\nTrump embodies and enacts this mindset, but he did not invent it. The US response to the coronavirus crisis has been paralysed by a contradiction that the Republicans have inserted into the heart of US democracy. On the one hand, they want to control all the levers of governmental power. On the other they have created a popular base by playing on the notion that government is innately evil and must not be trusted.\n\nThe contradiction was made manifest in two of Trump’s statements on the pandemic: on the one hand that he has “total authority”, and on the other that “I don’t take responsibility at all”. Caught between authoritarian and anarchic impulses, he is incapable of coherence.\n\nFertile ground\n\nBut this is not just Donald Trump. The crisis has shown definitively that Trump’s presidency is not an aberration. It has grown on soil long prepared to receive it. The monstrous blossoming of misrule has structure and purpose and strategy behind it.\n\nThere are very powerful interests who demand “freedom” in order to do as they like with the environment, society and the economy. They have infused a very large part of American culture with the belief that “freedom” is literally more important than life. My freedom to own assault weapons trumps your right not to get shot at school. Now, my freedom to go to the barber (“I Need a Haircut” read one banner this week in St Paul, Minnesota) trumps your need to avoid infection.\n\nUsually when this kind of outlandish idiocy is displaying itself, there is the comforting thought that, if things were really serious, it would all stop. People would sober up. Instead, a large part of the US has hit the bottle even harder.\n\nAnd the president, his party and their media allies keep supplying the drinks. There has been no moment of truth, no shock of realisation that the antics have to end. No one of any substance on the US right has stepped in to say: get a grip, people are dying here.\n\nThat is the mark of how deep the trouble is for the US – it is not just that Trump has treated the crisis merely as a way to feed tribal hatreds but that this behaviour has become normalised. When the freak show is live on TV every evening, and the star is boasting about his ratings, it is not really a freak show any more. For a very large and solid bloc of Americans, it is reality.\n\nAnd this will get worse before it gets better. Trump has at least eight more months in power. In his inaugural address in 2017, he evoked “American carnage” and promised to make it stop. But now that the real carnage has arrived, he is revelling in it. He is in his element.\n\nAs things get worse, he will pump more hatred and falsehood, more death-wish defiance of reason and decency, into the groundwater. If a new administration succeeds him in 2021, it will have to clean up the toxic dump he leaves behind. If he is re-elected, toxicity will have become the lifeblood of American politics.\n\nEither way, it will be a long time before the rest of the world can imagine America being great again.\n\nEnd","to es, world sees when they look at the USA now?

Highlands County Republican Party,en,R,"By Christian Ziegler - Vice Chairman, Republican Party of Florida -\nPresident Trump is leading a bold, whole-of-government approach to fighting the coronavirus, providing a sense of leadership and stability in an uncertain time. His administration has worked tirelessly to meet the outbreak on every front, wielding every available lever of government in an unprecedented effort to protect the health and safety of all Americans.\n\nAs the virus began to spread, President Trump acted quickly to ensure free testing for the novel coronavirus, as well as instituting key travel bans to halt the entry of infected people into our country. He has worked with the private sector to waive copays for coronavirus treatment, invoked the Defense Production Act to compel companies to produce needed virus-related equipment, and made the tough call — on the basis of advice from medical experts — to extend social distancing guidelines.\n\nAdditionally, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was signed into law on March 27. This landmark legislation will provide over $2 trillion worth of economic relief, directing crucial aid to people, businesses, states, and hospitals.\nThe CARES Act provides Florida with over $8.2 billion to offset coronavirus-related expenses. In addition to the $27 million Florida received from the CDC at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump on March 25 approved Florida’s Major Disaster Declaration, ensuring the Sunshine State’s access to FEMA’s $45.4 billion fund released for fighting the outbreak. This crucial federal aid for Florida comes alongside the good news that Governor Ron DeSantis has managed to secure 100% of Florida’s requests for federal medical equipment.\n\nAnother key plank of the CARES act is the Paycheck Protection Program, which will provide $350 billion to help small businesses weather the difficult economic straits brought on by coronavirus. Florida’s 2.5 million small businesses are the backbone of the Sunshine State’s economy, employing 3.4 million Floridians — in other words, representing over 40% of all Florida jobs.\n\nCrucially, if the business securing the loans meets some reasonable conditions — specifically, that 75% percent of the PPP loan goes towards payroll expenses, and that employees are kept on for at least two months — the loan will be fully forgiven by the government. This is smart, helpful policy, setting conditions to promote responsible, worker-first business behavior.\n\nHowever, this program isn’t just about money. It’s also about reassurance. The Paycheck Protection Program is a clear signal to business owners who have poured blood, sweat, and tears into their establishments that President Trump, Gov. DeSantis, and the federal government are here for them. This is a lifeline offered by a president who understands that small businesses are the backbone of our economy.\n\nThere will come a day — hopefully soon — when we beat back the invisible threat of this virus and can return to normal life. When that happens, our economy will roar back, and small businesses everywhere will open their doors and once more experience the boom we enjoyed before the coronavirus outbreak.\nUntil then, business owners in Florida and across America can rest knowing that President Trump and Gov. DeSantis will stop at nothing to provide innovative, pro-business solutions to help Americans through this uncertain time.\n\nChristian Ziegler is a Sarasota County commissioner and vice-chair of the Republican Party of Florida.","to es by Christian Ziegler - Vice Chairman, Republican Party of Florida",3.3618,3.73,-0.36819999999999986,0.36819999999999986

Eskamani released data on small business bridge loans this week, Thad has remained deadly silent knowing that over 37,000 small businesses may be crippled by his failure to lead on this issue.

Highlands County Republican Party,en,R,"We are seeing hopeful signs that the efforts by Americans to follow President Trump’s guidelines to slow the spread of this terrible COVID 19 virus that originated in Wuhan, China, are indeed working. We are sad for every life that has been lost, but at the same time we are thankful that Americans by and large are heeding the guidelines so that the original horrific projections of loss of life may not come to pass.\n\nWe are thankful for our wartime president and vice president who have exhibited strong and decisive leadership to mitigate and control the effects of the virus and to minimize the loss of life. President Trump made the early decision on Jan. 31 to stop flights from China despite strong criticism from many Democrats and the World Health Organization who felt that the step was totally unnecessary. Both China and the World Health Organization initially denied human-to-human transmission of the virus. How terribly wrong they were, and how thankful we are that President Trump did what is right for America and not what Joe Biden would have done. Instead of praising the president for closing travel from China on Jan. 31st, Joe Biden’s highly critical remarks of President Trump showed clearly that he would choose politics and attempts for political gain first, and not the best interests of America!\n\nWe are also very thankful to have Governor Ron DeSantis’ measured, informed and effective leadership guiding our state during this terrible crisis. Florida is very fortunate to have Ron DeSantis as our governor. And we are all extremely thankful that we do not have the Democrats 2018 choice for governor. The newspapers that endorsed Democrat Andrew Gillum in 2018 owe Floridians an apology. Governor DeSantis is resolutely leading the state through the coronavirus outbreak with reasoned, steady and effective actions to protect the health and rights of Floridians. Meanwhile, Florida Democrat leaders and their newspaper allies are making the same mistakes that they made in 2018. Many are again supporting the Democrat talking points and are firmly of the opinion that they should never let a good crisis pass without taking full advantage of the opportunity to score highly partisan cheap political points and attempt to malign one of our nation’s most popular and effective governors.\n\nIn prior wars, the nation came together in a united front to protect America and to win the war on a highly visible enemy. With this war and this invisible enemy, there seems to be no evidence by leaders of the Democrat Party of wanting to unite and to win the war. Some Dem leaders and their media allies appear to be hoping that that the economic shutdown will be forced to continue. Leaders on both sides of the aisle need to look for ways to balance the safety and well-being of the public while also protecting our country’s economy. That is a very delicate balance, and instead of offering solutions to these challenges with a unified front, the Democrats find it easier to criticize. Their goal is to say, “I told you so!” no matter the outcome.\n\nIt is a time to unite and to win the war on this invisible enemy! We are very thankful that we have leaders both in Washington, DC and in Tallahassee that truly care about doing everything possible to safeguard our lives, minimize further loss of life, and mitigate the effects of this horrible coronavirus on our people and our economy. We would have even more reason to be thankful if the opposition party and their media allies cared more about winning the war than winning the next election!\n\nThese are truly unprecedented times, with rapid changes daily. We are most thankful for the dedicated, often selfless, Americans, who are working around the clock to minimize the contagion, care for all the sick, keep us safe, and keep us supplied with groceries. To all these heroes we are indeed thankful, and we offer our most heartfelt thanks!\n\nE.J. Claire is a resident of Lake Placid and the Republican State Committeeman for Highlands County.

Re-Elect Michael McElroy-Gilchrist County Tax Collector,en,R,"My name is Michael McElroy and I am seeking re-election as your Gilchrist County Tax Collector.  In July of 2019 I was appointed by the Honorable Ron DeSantis, Governor of Florida to fill this vacated position.  Before my appointment I worked in the private sector-financial services industry for 35 years as a local banker.  This experience in the financial services industry and others listed below prepared me well to represent the citizens of Gilchrist County and lead the office of Tax Collector.\n \nMy passion for community service began in 1984 at the age of 19.  Serving in various capacities for Gilchrist County entities such as: Rotary, Education Foundation, Character Council, SHIP, Relay for Life, and the Republican Executive Committee. The Chamber of Commerce presented me with the Citizen of the Year Award in 2016 and in 2019 co-winner of the J. Min Ayers Lifetime Achievement Award with my wife Christie.   \n\nI earned a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration in 2004 while working 50 hours a week and raising a family. This and other life experiences have taught me to prioritize, work tirelessly, and give 100% to every task undertaken.  Since my appointment in July of 2019 I have successfully completed 120 instructional hours as required by the Florida Department of Revenue to be designated a Certified Tax Collector, awarded after two years employment.   Christie and I were married in 1989 and are blessed with two children, Brandon & Alyssa, both graduating from Gilchrist County Schools.  My wife and I are active members of the Cherry Sink Church of Christ.    \n\nYou as citizens deserve a Tax Collector that’s honest, knowledgeable, accountable, accessible, community centric and innovative.  My experience has groomed me to be frugal, to stretch budgetary dollars, and have the ability to think independently.  I urge you to vote Michael McElroy for proven leadership in faith and family, business, community and tireless efforts since appointment.

Executive Order 20-91 had substantive and drafting flaws, but it was a significant step forward.  What went largely unnoticed, however, was that DeSantis quickly issued Executive Order 20-92 amending its predecessor and making things worse.\n  \nSection 4 of EO 20-91 originally provided:  “This Order shall supersede any conflicting official action or order issued by local officials in response to C0VID-19 but only to the extent that such action or order allows essential services or essential activities prohibited by this Executive Order.”  EO 20-92 deleted the language following “COVID-19,” specifically the qualification beginning “but only . . .”\n\nEffectively, the Amendment prohibits local officials from protecting constituents during this public health emergency.  For example, the original DeSantis order lists “attending religious services conducted in churches, synagogues and other houses of worship” as an “essential activity.”  Hillsborough County has limited gatherings of more than ten people, including by faith-based organizations.  The pastor of a megachurch was arrested for defying such order and endangering parishioners.  Under the Amendment, packing crowds in houses of worship can no longer be precluded.\n\nThe DeSantis Amendment is a great step backward.\n\nDeSantis Executive Order 20-92, Amending EO 20-91, Apr. 1, 2020, is found at https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2020/EO_20-92.pdf",es: AMENDMENT TO DESANTIS STAY-AT-HO,2.0937,2.9953,-0.9015999999999997,0.9015999999999997

She's going to be a, as good as anybody that has served on that Court.  We really feel that.  Uh, we have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, says she's the single greatest student he's ever had.  He's been a professor for a long time at a great school, and, uh, we just, uh, we won the election, and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise.

JOE BIDEN,en,D,"I, uh – the American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is, and that say occurs when they vote for, A) United States Senators, and when they vote for the President of the United States.  They're not going to get that chance now, because we're in the middle of an election already.  The election has already started.  Tens of thousands of people have already voted, and, so the thing that should happen is we should wait.  We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is, because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President.  Now, what's at stake here is the President has made it clear he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.  He's been running on that.  He ran on that, and he's been governing on that.  He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of, uh, the, the Affordable Care Act, which, uh, will strip 20 million people from having insurance, health insurance now, if it, if they, if it goes into Court.  And, and, uh, the Justice – and I have nothing, I'm not opposed to the Justice, because she seems like a very fine person.  What she's written before she went on the bench, which is her right, is she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional.  The other thing that's on the Court – and if, if, and if it's struck down, what happens?  Women's rights are fundamentally changed.  Once again, a woman could be held, pay more money because she has a preexisting condition of pregnancy.  We're able to, uh, they're able to charge a woman more for the same exact procedure a man did – gets.  And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act.  And there's a hundred million people that have preexisting conditions, and they'll be taken away as well.  Those preexisting conditions, the insurance companies are going to love this.  And, so, it's just not appropriate to do this before this election.  If he wins the election and the Senate is Democrat or Republican, then it – he goes forward.  If not, we should wait until February.","Yo, uh – el pueblo estadounidense tiene el derecho de opinar en quien el candidato a la Corte Suprema es, y esa opinión ocurre cuando votan por A) senadores de los Estados Unidos, y cuando votan por el presidente de los Estados Unidos. No van a tener ese chance ahora mismo, porque ya estamos en el medio de una elección. Ya ha comenzado la elección. Decenas de miles de personas ya han votado, y, entonces lo que debe pasar es que debemos esperar. Debemos esperar y ver que el resultado de esta elección, porque la única manera que el pueblo estadounidense puede expresar sus opiniones es a través de quien eligen ser el Presidente y quien eligen ser en Vicepresidente. Ahora, lo que está en riesgo aquí es que el Presidente ha sido claro que él quiere deshacerse del Affordable Care Act. Ha sido una promesa electoral. El hizo esa promesa electoral, y él lo ha mantenido. Él está en la Corte Suprema ahorita tratando de deshacerse del, uh, del, del Affordable Care Act, que, uh, sacará a 20 millones de personas de tener seguro, seguro médico ahora, si el, si ellos, si eso va a la Corte. Y, y, uh, la Jueza – y no tengo nada, no estoy opuesto a la Jueza, porque ella parece ser una buena persona. Lo que ella ha escrito antes que ella fue a la magistratura, que es su derecho, es que ella piensa que el Affordable Care Act no es constitucional.
